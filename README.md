# Zumdahl-Challenge-Problems-Solutions
These contain the challenge problem solutions for Steven S. Zumdahl's textbook, "Chemical Principles," specifically the 8th edition. If you're using an older edition, this will likely have all of the same challenge problems, perhaps more. If you're using a newer edition, hopefully it will still be of use. 

As of now, these solutions are incomplete. However many problems I may have as you're reading (I'm writing this at 1 problem solved), there are more to come.

I plan on writing solutions for every odd problem in the first several chapters at a minimum, but may choose to write solutions for selected even problems if I find the time.

I'm going to try to keep these solutions fairly high level to keep brevity, but also as an effort to encourage any readers to work along with the solutions to reach the next step. Make sure to give each problem an honest try before looking here. I would say for each problem, spend maybe 20-30 minutes trying out anything that comes to mind regarding it. If you've found an answer, check with the answer in the back of your textbook to see if its correct. If its not, look back through your work for silly mistakes. Once you've done that and still haven't gotten the correct answer, come back to the problem later in the day, or the next day. Resolve from the beginning no matter how far you got, and if you don't get the problem right, work along with the solution manual.

As far as errors go, there may be instances where I accidently write the wrong number, variable, etc. I'm revising these as I go along, but if you notice something, please let me know!
