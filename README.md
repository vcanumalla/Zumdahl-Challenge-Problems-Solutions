# Zumdahl-Challenge-Problems-Solutions
These contain the solutions for Steven S. Zumdahl's textbook, "Chemical Principles."
As of now, these solutions are incomplete. However many problems I may have as you're reading (I'm writing this at 1 problem solved), there are more to come.
I plan on writing solutions for every odd problem in the first several chapters at a minimum, but may choose to write solutions for selected even problems if I find the time.
